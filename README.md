# Peer Consensus Layer

### Node Identity
A node is an IP address that is signed by a user's private key. Extensions may be nodes but it's unlikely they would be leaders. Nodes may be validators but only when there's heavy system load.

## Examples

### Alice makes a transaction

#### Mempools

a. raw_tx_mempool - first entries of tx requests
b. validation_tasks_mempool - validation tasks required to process transactions
c. locked_utxo_mempool - utxos in this list are invalidated from entry into raw_tx_mempool entries
d. processing_tx_mempool - transactions that moving through the consensus
e. tx_mempool - transactions approved to be blocked or otherwise finalized in a DLT's protocol

#### Workflow

1. Alice sends Bob a transaction of one coin to a leader node, Charlie. Alice includes the tx fee and a validation stake.
    
    tx_data = {
        to: [bob_address: 1],
        from: [alice_utxo1: 2],
        user: alice_address,
        sig: alice_signature, // signs this message, without the "sig" property
        stake: 0.2,
        fee: 0.1
    } // total of 1.3 coins required, .9 returns to alice_address as new utxo on finality.

2. Charlie hashes the raw transaction to get the raw_tx_id and starts a raw_tx_mempool entry under his node id property. Charlie also adds Alice's raw_tx_id to the validation_tasks_mempool. Charlie gossips to 3 leaders who continue to gossip the transaction to other leaders. At this point, UTXO's used in the transaction are put on the locked_utxo_mempool to prevent double-spend attacks. 

    raw_tx_mempool = {
        charlie_id: {
            raw_tx_id: {
                tx_data,
                validation_timestamps: [],
                validation_tasks: [],
                tx_timestamp: 1751728707356
            }
        }
    }

3. The other leaders send Charlie validation tasks for Alice to complete. Charlie approves validation tasks to send to Alice sorting by the tx_timestamp on other raw transactions. The number of tasks is proportionate to total tasks in validation_tasks_mempool divided by validators available. The first task type is validating Alice's signature and spending power, the timestamps from which go into the validation_timestamps array.

    validation_tasks = [
        leader2_id: [
            {task: task_id1, complete: false}, {task_id2, complete: false}
        ],
        leader8_id: [
            {task: task_id1, complete: false}, {task: task_id2, , complete: false}
        ]
    ]

4. Alice completes the assigned validation tasks and if valid, Alice reports the timestamp to the leaders with her signature on each completed task. Leader 2 and leader 8 in the above example report the completed timestamps and task_id to Charlie. Charlie marks validation tasks complete as true and removes Alice's raw_tx_id from the validation_tasks_mempool.

5. When tasks are complete and Alice's transaction's raw_tx_mempool entry has the required number of validating timestamps (set by network configuration), Charlie removes the transaction from raw_tx_mempool, averages the validation_timestamps, signs it, and puts it in processing_tx_mempool. Another task type is put in the validation_task_mempool to send to validators -- check Charlie's math from averaging timestamps and hash the {timestamp: tx_data} value to get Alice's tx_id. 

6. The validator who gets Alice's tx_id in Step 5 broadcasts the transaction to 3 random leaders to put in their processing_tx_mempool, add/check that finality validation tasks for their chain of choice. and then those leaders remove the entry in their raw_tx_mempool and associated validation_tasks_mempool entries. Leaders gossip the transaction to all other leaders.

    processing_tx_mempool: {
        tx_id: { // timestamp used is the average generated in step 5
            1751730407001: tx_data,
            sig: charlie_signature
            leader: charlie_id
        }
    }

6. The final validation task type depends on the chain. At this point Alice is provided with a new UTXO with her change and stake return. Bob's new UTXO is awaiting final validation. For our example, we will use the XMBL's Cubic DLT protocol's requirement to calculate the digital root of the tx_id and put into a tx_mempool for further inclusion in the protocol's cubic geometry.

In the case of a invalidation at any step, all entries into mempools are removed and sent to all leaders who gossip to nodes.

### A leader is born

Nodes send a pulse every 20 seconds to nodes in their family. A receiving node sets the ip address with a timestamp property in their uptime_mempool and sends a message back. If more than 60 seconds passes between pulses from any node in their family, the node is removed from their uptime_mempool. For every pulse received from a node after the timestamp is set, we update the count by 1. The time between receiving the response is averaged into the node's response time value (add the new response time to the running average and divide by the updated count to get the new average)

    {
        45.228.345: {
            1751739100498: [1, 201]
        }
    }

Every 2 hours nodes broadcast their uptime_mempool data to nodes and validators. Nodes and validators elect leaders based on most uptime and fastest response time averages. The nominated leaders are broadcast to all nodes who then do 3 rounds of run-off voting for their top choices based on their individual uptime_mempool performance stats. When the run-off voting is complete, the leaders are sorted in an array by average performance. The new leader list is hashed and broadcast to all nodes. The number of leaders depends on validation_task_mempool load for the previous 2 hours. A node that doesn't participate and broadcast as per these rules is disqualified to be a leader for 24 hours.
